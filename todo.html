enable extra button
enable missing button

degrees<->radians, radians<->degrees key(s) (or use units for conversion)
add angle units? breaks strictly following SI-units but would assist formula finding, radians would be scalar equivelent for unit check
store/recall memory button OR list of most recent results that can be recalled
More constants, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants
Mode button (and mode indicators on display):
  hyper sin/cos/tan (hyper button would be 'sticky')
  mode degree, radian
  mode float, scientific, engineering (always scientific and always a power of 10^3)
  mode set-precision (default to 8 digits)
  formula filter/edit button here or on list?
program button for units/constants, show on list, press 'program', list item and finally key to replace
method of adding new units, constants or formulas by user, integrity checks (no duplicates, bad shortUnits) for units and constants
eliminate 'E' for scientific notation, show in 10^(superscript) form
show units on two lines (numerator/denominator) in smaller text
mixed units, highlight N, W, J keys when possible. W=J/s, J=W s, etc. Pressing time unit after will only change the 'detached' s (to support W/h)
keyboard shortcuts for 0-9, ., +, -, *, /, =, (, ), E(for EE), M(for +/-), Esc(for CE/C), return(another =)
formula button, allows filtering formulas shown, shows number of matching formulas (sort of an alternate view for list)

App like features:
improve calculator frame
fill screen / dynamic size for smaller mobile devices
tooltip text for units and constants (and formula variables?)
color and style buttons by group (length, mass, time, other, derived units / numbers, infix, singles, etc / control keys (leftmost))
animated keypresses
animate units being added / canceled ?
animate hiding keyboard when lists or units is shown, slide new keys in or flip animation
typescript formulas: https://jkorpela.fi/math/ or http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/ (partially doing so now with unicode)
