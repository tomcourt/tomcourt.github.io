* bug? first press of unit key such as m to deconstruct watts doesn't add m factor
* degrees<->radians, radians<->degrees key(s) (or use units for conversion)
* add angle units? breaks strictly following SI-units but would assist formula finding, radians would be scalar equivelent for unit check
* More constants, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants
* More formulas, see: https://www.madison-lake.k12.oh.us/userfiles/680/Classes/16192/IED-Review%20Engineering%20Formula%20Sheet.pdf
* Mode button (and mode indicators on display):
-   hyper sin/cos/tan (hyper button would be 'sticky')
-   mode degree, radian
-   mode float, scientific, engineering (always scientific and always a power of 10^3)
-   mode set-precision (default to 8 digits)
* program button for units/constants, show on list, press 'program', list item and finally key to replace
* method of adding new units, constants or formulas by user,
-   integrity checks (no duplicates, bad shortUnits) for units and constants
* eliminate 'E' for scientific notation, show in 10^(superscript) form
* show units on two lines (numerator/denominator) in smaller text
* mixed units, highlight N, W, J keys when possible, also m, s and kg
-   J = W s, W = J/s, J = N m, N = J/m, W = N m/s, N = W s/m
-   pressing time unit after will only change the 'detached' units, such as s (to support W/h)
-   even better, be able to handle generic mixed units, field strength V/m for example,
-   add an SI key to units screen, that cycles between
* formula filter button on list screen, reset shows all, allows filtering formulas shown
-   shows number of matching formulas under each group
-   hide button on each group, sticky
* Add 'Backspace' to keyboard and calculator keyboard

App like features:
* 'legend' group at start of list for units and constants for keys in keyboard
* animate units being added / canceled ?
* animate hiding keyboard when lists or units is shown, slide new keys in or flip animation
* typescript formulas: https://jkorpela.fi/math/ or http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/ (partially doing so now with unicode)
* progressive web app: https://medium.com/@firt/progressive-web-apps-on-ios-are-here-d00430dee3a7
