<h4>Built in help</h4>
Built in help is available by pressing the <b>?</b> button on the toolbar.<p>

<h4>Trouble understanding the deep-blue line on the route</h4>
Here is another way to look at it. - The slider thumb on the time slider control represents a single point in time and the airplane on the map represents a single point over the ground at that time. The deep blue line on the time slider represents the 2 hour time range that thunderstorms are being forecasted for by weather stations on the map. The deep blue line on the route represents the route of the plane during that same 2 hour time.<p>

<h4>Where does the weather come from</h4>
The weather is supplied from NOAA. The 'Bug Reports' page has links to the raw weather data sources. Details of how to interpret the weather data are available <a href="weatherdetail.html">here.</a> <p>
