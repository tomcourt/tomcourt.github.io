Introduction

  The physical calculator is intended to help solve physics problems. Unlike a
  conventional calculator, this calculator works with measurements. A measurement
  has a numeric value as well as a unit (such as meters, kilograms or seconds).
  Units are carried through a calculation, so if you take 20 m (meters) and
  divide it by 5 s (seconds), the results would be 4 m/s (a speed). Or if you
  cube a length like 0.1 m, the result would be 0.001 m^3 (a volume of 1 liter).

  Just like when you solve physics problems on paper this helps ensure sensible
  answers. However for this calculator, it also helps provides several other
  features. All units are handled internally as SI units, in this way conversions
  are easily done, constants only need to be provided in one common form and
  formulas also only need to be provided in one form.

General

  Buttons are mostly similar to a TI scientific calculator.

  Math operations happen to both the value and the unit. Multiplying and dividing
  combine the units of the two operands. Adding must be done with identical units.
  Operations that result in non-sensible units, such as square root of a volume
  are not allowed. Operations such as sin or log can only be done on scalars
  (numbers with no units).

Units

  To enter a measurement with a unit, enter a number, then press the 'unit'
  button. The 'unit' button shows a list of most commonly used units. The units
  are arranged largely in rows, length, mass, time, electrical, temperature.
  Units are multipled as they are entered. Pressing 'm' once will be a length in
  meters. A second time becomes m*m (shown as m^2), an area. A third time m^3, a
  volume. Pressing 'unit' again will exit unit mode.

  To enter a ratio'd unit such as speed:
    enter the numeric value
    press 'unit'
    press a length such as 'm'
    press the '1/un' key, note how the diamond cursor moves to the denominator
    press a time such as 's'
    press 'unit' again to exit the unit mode

  Units can be editted by using the '1/un' key to cancel out units. For example
  m^2 can be changed to m by pressing 1/un and then m. The numerator and
  denominator m's cancel out leaving m. Press '#' to remove all units (convert to
  scalar).

Conversions

  The unit screen can also be used to handle unit conversions. If a unit type
  such as 'kg' already exists, but a different unit of the same dimension,
  (in this case mass) is pressed such as 'oz', the value will be converted to
  the new unit. This works for more complex units also, such as m/s being changed
  to mi/h.

  The SI+ key can be used to cycle between various SI unit forms of complex units,
  for example, W cycles between J/s, A V and kg m^2 / s^3, see list of derived units
  below for details.

Constants

  The 'cnst' button shows a list of useful constants. The 'list' button shows
  additional constants. Pressing 'cnst' again returns to normal mode without
  entering a constant.

Implicit formulas

  An automatic solver (using dimensional analyis) will solve simple physics
  problems that don't require any physical constants. This includes ohm's laws,
  speed/distance/time problems and similar.

  For example, enter the following:
    '20', 'unit', 'm', '1/un', 's', 'kwn'     (given a speed of 20 m/s)
    '5', 'unit', 'm', 'kwn'                   (and given a distance of 5 m)
    'unit', 's', 'unkn'                       (how long would it take to travel)
    Note - for the unknown, the value is ignored, onlty the units are significant.

  Pressing 'list' (followed possibly by the 'implicit' button) will show the
  formula used to perform the calculation.

Explicit formulas

  For more complex problems, the explicit solver searchs a library of physical
  formulas to provide a solution. It works identically to the implicit solver.
  Some implicit correct formulas are also included in explicit form to put a
  name to the physical law and assist in showing the result is correct.

  When 'list' is pressed and 'explicit' is selected, multiple solutions may be
  provided. These can be scrolled through using the arrow keys provided.

  Missing and Extra will show partial matches with missing or extra terms to 
  assist in finding the correct formula.
